# 🟢 Day 15 – Queue

## 🎯 Objective
- Understand Queue data structure
- Learn FIFO principle
- Implement Queue using list and deque
- Understand time complexity
- Solve queue-based problems

---

# 🔹 What is a Queue?

A Queue is a linear data structure that follows:

FIFO → First In, First Out

Example:
If we insert 10, 20, 30

Queue becomes:
Front → 10 → 20 → 30 → Rear

The first element inserted (10) will be removed first.

---

# 🔹 Queue Operations

| Operation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Enqueue | Add element at rear |
| Dequeue | Remove element from front |
| Peek | View front element |
| isEmpty | Check if queue is empty |

---

# 🔹 Queue Using Python List (Basic Implementation)

```python
queue = []

# Enqueue
queue.append(10)
queue.append(20)
queue.append(30)

# Dequeue
queue.pop(0)
```

⚠️ Problem:
`pop(0)` is O(n) because elements shift left.

---

# 🔹 Efficient Queue Using deque

```python
from collections import deque

queue = deque()

# Enqueue
queue.append(10)
queue.append(20)
queue.append(30)

# Dequeue
queue.popleft()
```

Now both operations are efficient.

---

# 🔹 Time Complexity

Using List:

Enqueue → O(1)  
Dequeue → O(n)

Using deque:

Enqueue → O(1)  
Dequeue → O(1)

---

# 🔹 Example

```python
from collections import deque

q = deque()
q.append(1)
q.append(2)
q.append(3)
q.popleft()
q.append(4)

print(q)
```

Output:
deque([2, 3, 4])

# 🔹 Stack vs Queue

| Stack | Queue |
|--------|--------|
| LIFO | FIFO |
| append() / pop() | append() / popleft() |
| Last element removed first | First element removed first |

---

# 🔹 Real Interview Problem

Implement Queue using Stacks.

Idea:
- Use two stacks
- One for input
- One for output
- Transfer elements when needed

---

# 🔹 Applications of Queue

- CPU scheduling
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Task scheduling
- Buffer handling
- Print queue system

---

# 🔥 Key Takeaways

- Queue follows FIFO principle
- deque is preferred in Python
- Avoid using pop(0) for performance
- Queue is important for BFS and scheduling problems
- Understand front and rear concept
