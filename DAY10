# 🟢 Day 10 – Binary Search Applications

## 🎯 Objective
- Apply Binary Search to real interview problems
- Find first and last occurrence
- Understand search insert position
- Learn lower bound concept
- Recognize binary search patterns

---

# 🔹 1. First Occurrence of Element

Given a sorted array with duplicates, find the first occurrence of target.

Example:
arr = [1,2,2,2,3,4]
target = 2
Output = 1



---

## Approach
When target is found:
- Store the index
- Move left to check if earlier occurrence exists

---

## Code

```python
def first_occurrence(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    result = -1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2

        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            right = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    return result
```

Time Complexity: O(log n)  
Space Complexity: O(1)

---

# 🔹 2. Last Occurrence of Element

Example:
arr = [1,2,2,2,3]
target = 2
Output = 3

---

## Approach
When target is found:
- Store the index
- Move right to check if later occurrence exists

---

## Code

```python
def last_occurrence(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    result = -1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2

        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            left = mid + 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    return result
```

Time Complexity: O(log n)  
Space Complexity: O(1)

---

# 🔹 3. Search Insert Position

Return index if found, else return position where it should be inserted.

Example:
arr = [1,3,5,6]
target = 2
Output = 1

---

## Code

```python
def search_insert(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2

        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    return left
```

Time Complexity: O(log n)  
Space Complexity: O(1)

---

# 🔹 4. Lower Bound Concept

Lower Bound = First element >= target

Used frequently in interviews.

---

## Code Pattern

```python
def lower_bound(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr)

    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2

        if arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid

    return left
```

Time Complexity: O(log n)

---

# 🔹 Recognizing Binary Search Problems

Use Binary Search when:
- Array is sorted
- Find first/last occurrence
- Search insert position
- Find minimum satisfying condition
- Find maximum satisfying condition
- Search in rotated sorted array
- Find peak element

---

# 🔥 Key Takeaways

- Binary Search always halves the search space
- Time Complexity remains O(log n)
- Adjust left and right carefully
- First occurrence → move left
- Last occurrence → move right
- Always check loop condition (left <= right)
