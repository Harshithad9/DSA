Loops (for & while)
🎯 Objective

Understand repetition

Learn for and while loops

Solve classic looping problems
 
🔹 Why Loops?

Loops help execute a block of code multiple times without repetition.

🔹 for Loop
for i in range(start, end):
    code


Example:

for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)


👉 Prints numbers from 1 to 5

🔹 range() Function
range(5)        # 0 to 4
range(1, 5)     # 1 to 4
range(1, 10, 2) # 1,3,5,7,9

🔹 while Loop
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1


⚠️ Condition must change to avoid infinite loop.

🔹 for vs while
for loop	while loop
Fixed iterations	Condition-based
Cleaner syntax	Flexible
Mostly used in DSA	Used when iterations unknown
🔹 Example: Sum of First N Numbers
n = int(input("Enter n: "))
total = 0

for i in range(1, n + 1):
    total += i

print("Sum:", total)

🔹 Factorial of a Number
n = int(input("Enter number: "))
fact = 1

for i in range(1, n + 1):
    fact *= i

print("Factorial:", fact)

🔹 Nested Loops
for i in range(1, 4):
    for j in range(1, 4):
        print(i, j)


🧠 Nested loops often lead to O(n²) time complexity.
