Day 2 – Conditional Statements & Logic Building
🎯 Objective

Understand decision making

Use if, elif, else

Build logical thinking

🔹 Why Conditions?

Conditions allow a program to take decisions based on input.

Example:

IF age ≥ 18 → Can vote

ELSE → Cannot vote

🔹 if Statement
if condition:
    code


Example:

age = 20
if age >= 18:
    print("Eligible to vote")

🔹 Comparison Operators
Operator	Meaning
==	Equal
!=	Not equal
>	Greater than
<	Less than
>=	Greater or equal
<=	Less or equal

⚠️ = is assignment
⚠️ == is comparison

🔹 if–else Statement
num = int(input("Enter number: "))

if num % 2 == 0:
    print("Even")
else:
    print("Odd")

🔹 if–elif–else (Multiple Conditions)
marks = int(input("Enter marks: "))

if marks >= 90:
    print("Grade A")
elif marks >= 75:
    print("Grade B")
elif marks >= 50:
    print("Grade C")
else:
    print("Fail")

🔹 Logical Operators
Operator	Meaning
and	Both conditions true
or	At least one true
not	Reverse condition
🔹 Example: Largest of Three Numbers
if a > b and a > c:
    print(a)
elif b > c:
    print(b)
else:
    print(c)
