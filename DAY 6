# 🔹 What is a String?

A string is a sequence of characters.

Example:
```python
s = "python"
Each character has an index:

Index:  0  1  2  3  4  5
Value:  p  y  t  h  o  n


Accessing characters:

print(s[0])  # p

🔹 Strings are Immutable

Strings cannot be modified directly.

❌ Not allowed:

s[0] = 'P'


This gives:

TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment

🔹 How to Modify a String (Correct Way)

Since strings are immutable, we create a new string.

Example:

s = "hello"
s = "H" + s[1:]
print(s)   # Hello


Explanation:

s[1:] → "ello"

"H" + "ello" → "Hello"

🔹 General Pattern to Replace Character at Index i
s = s[:i] + new_char + s[i+1:]


Example:

s = "abcdef"
s = s[:3] + "X" + s[4:]
print(s)  # abcXef

🔹 String Traversal
Method 1 – Index Based
for i in range(len(s)):
    print(s[i])

Method 2 – Direct Traversal
for ch in s:
    print(ch)

🔹 String Slicing

Syntax:

s[start:end:step]


Important rules:

Includes start

Excludes end

Examples:

s = "abcdef"

s[:3]     # abc
s[2:5]    # cde
s[1:]     # bcdef
s[::-1]   # fedcba (reverse)

🔹 Important String Methods
Convert Case
s.upper()
s.lower()

Replace Word
s.replace("python", "JAVA")


Replace only first occurrence:

s.replace("python", "JAVA", 1)

Split and Join
words = s.split()
" ".join(words)
