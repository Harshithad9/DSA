# 🟢 Day 7 – Time & Space Complexity

## 🎯 Objective
- Understand Time Complexity
- Understand Space Complexity
- Learn Big-O notation
- Analyze loops properly

---

# 🔹 What is Time Complexity?

Time Complexity measures how the running time of an algorithm grows as input size increases.

We measure growth pattern, not actual seconds.

---

# 🔹 Common Time Complexities

| Complexity | Meaning | Example |
|------------|----------|----------|
| O(1) | Constant | Access arr[0] |
| O(n) | Linear | Single loop |
| O(n²) | Quadratic | Nested loops |
| O(n³) | Cubic | Triple nested loops |
| O(log n) | Logarithmic | Binary Search |

---

# 🔹 Big-O Rules

- Ignore constants  
  O(5n) → O(n)

- Ignore smaller terms  
  O(n² + n) → O(n²)

- Multiply nested loops

- Add separate loops

---

# 🔹 Examples

## Example 1
```python
for i in range(n):
    print(i)
```
Time Complexity: O(n)

---

## Example 2
```python
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        print(i, j)
```
Time Complexity: O(n²)

---

## Example 3
```python
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(100):
        print(i, j)
```
Time Complexity: O(n)

(100 is constant, ignored)

---

## Example 4
```python
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i):
        print(i, j)
```
Time Complexity: O(n²)

---

## Example 5
```python
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i):
        for k in range(j):
            print(i, j, k)
```
Time Complexity: O(n³)

---

# 🔹 What is Space Complexity?

Space Complexity measures extra memory used.

Example:
```python
a = 10
b = 20
```
Space Complexity: O(1)

Example:
```python
arr = [1,2,3,4]
```
Space Complexity: O(n)
