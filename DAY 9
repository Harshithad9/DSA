# 🔹 What is Binary Search?

Binary Search is an efficient searching algorithm that works on **sorted arrays**.

Instead of checking every element, it repeatedly divides the search space in half.

⚠️ Binary Search works only on sorted arrays.

---

# 🔹 Why Binary Search?

For an array of size n:

- Linear Search → O(n)
- Binary Search → O(log n)

Example:

If n = 1,000,000  
Binary Search takes about 20 steps.

---

# 🔹 Core Idea

1. Find middle element
2. If target == middle → return index
3. If target < middle → search left half
4. If target > middle → search right half
5. Repeat until found or search space is empty

Each step halves the search space.

---

# 🔹 Iterative Binary Search

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2

        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    return -1
```

Time Complexity: O(log n)  
Space Complexity: O(1)

---

# 🔹 Recursive Binary Search

```python
def binary_search(arr, left, right, target):
    if left > right:
        return -1

    mid = (left + right) // 2

    if arr[mid] == target:
        return mid
    elif arr[mid] < target:
        return binary_search(arr, mid + 1, right, target)
    else:
        return binary_search(arr, left, mid - 1, target)
```

Time Complexity: O(log n)  
Space Complexity: O(log n) (due to recursion stack)

---

# 🔹 Safe Mid Calculation

In languages like Java/C++, this prevents overflow:

```python
mid = left + (right - left) // 2
```

---

# 🔹 Understanding O(log n)

If:

```python
while n > 1:
    n = n // 2
```

Each step halves n.

Example:

16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1

Number of steps = log₂(n)

Therefore:
Time Complexity = O(log n)

---

# 🔹 Logarithmic Growth Pattern

If you see:

- n = n / 2
- i = i * 2
- j *= 2

Think immediately:
O(log n)

---

# 🔹 Combined Complexity Example

```python
for i in range(n):
    j = 1
    while j < n:
        j *= 2
```

Outer loop → O(n)  
Inner loop → O(log n)

Total → O(n log n)

---

# 🔹 Common Mistakes

- Using Binary Search on unsorted array
- Wrong loop condition (must use left <= right)
- Infinite loop due to wrong mid update
- Forgetting to return -1 if not found

---

# 🔹 Practice Problems

- Binary Search (basic)
- Search Insert Position
- First Occurrence of element
- Last Occurrence of element

---

# 🔥 Key Takeaways

- Binary Search reduces search space by half
- Time Complexity = O(log n)
- Works only on sorted arrays
- Recognize halving/doubling patterns
- Multiply nested loops carefully
