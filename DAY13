# 🟢 Day 13 – Linked List (Fundamentals)

## 🎯 Objective
- Understand Linked List structure
- Learn Node creation
- Create a Linked List
- Traverse a Linked List
- Insert at beginning and end
- Delete a node
- Compare Linked List with Array

---

# 🔹 What is a Linked List?

A Linked List is a linear data structure made up of nodes.

Each node contains:
- Data
- Pointer (next)

Structure:

[data | next] → [data | next] → ... → None

Memory is not contiguous like arrays.

---

# 🔹 Node Class (Python)

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
```

---

# 🔹 Creating a Linked List

```python
node1 = Node(10)
node2 = Node(20)
node3 = Node(30)

node1.next = node2
node2.next = node3
```

Structure:
10 → 20 → 30 → None

---

# 🔹 Traversing a Linked List

```python
def traverse(head):
    current = head
    while current:
        print(current.data)
        current = current.next
```

Time Complexity: O(n)

---

# 🔹 Insert at Beginning

```python
def insert_at_beginning(head, data):
    new_node = Node(data)
    new_node.next = head
    return new_node
```

Example:
10 → 20 → 30

Insert 5 at beginning:

5 → 10 → 20 → 30 → None

Time Complexity: O(1)

---

# 🔹 Insert at End

```python
def insert_at_end(head, data):
    new_node = Node(data)

    if not head:
        return new_node

    current = head
    while current.next:
        current = current.next

    current.next = new_node
    return head
```

Example:
10 → 20 → 30

Insert 40 at end:

10 → 20 → 30 → 40 → None

Time Complexity: O(n)

---

# 🔹 Delete a Node (By Value)

```python
def delete_node(head, key):
    current = head
    prev = None

    while current and current.data != key:
        prev = current
        current = current.next

    if not current:
        return head

    if not prev:
        return current.next

    prev.next = current.next
    return head
```

Example:
10 → 20 → 30

Delete 20:

10 → 30 → None

Time Complexity: O(n)

---

# 🔹 Array vs Linked List

| Operation | Array | Linked List |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| Access by index | O(1) | O(n) |
| Insert at beginning | O(n) | O(1) |
| Insert at end | O(1)* | O(n) |
| Delete | O(n) | O(n) |

*Dynamic array resize may cost O(n)

---

# 🔹 Important Concepts

- Head pointer
- Node structure
- Traversal
- Pointer redirection
- Null termination

---

# 🔥 Key Takeaways

- Linked List stores elements dynamically
- Each node stores data and pointer
- Insert at beginning is O(1)
- Traversal is O(n)
- Deletion requires pointer adjustment
- Think in terms of pointer manipulation
