# 🟢 Day 1 – Python Basics & Input/Output

## 🎯 Objective
- Understand what programming is
- Learn Python syntax
- Use variables and data types
- Take input and display output

---

## 🔹 What is Programming?
Programming is the process of giving step-by-step instructions to a computer to perform a task.

Python is:
- Easy to read
- Beginner-friendly
- Widely used in DSA and interviews

---

## 🔹 First Python Program

```python
print("Hello, World!")

print() is used to display output
Text inside quotes is a string

Variables

Variables store data values.

age = 20
name = "Harshitha"



## 🔹 Data Types
| Data Type | Example      |
| --------- | ------------ |
| int       | 10           |
| float     | 3.14         |
| str       | "Hello"      |
| bool      | True / False |



## 🔹 Check data type:

x = 10
print(type(x))

🔹 Taking Input from User
name = input("Enter your name: ")


⚠️ input() always returns a string.



## 🔹 Convert input to integer:

age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

| Operator | Meaning        |
| -------- | -------------- |
| +        | Addition       |
| -        | Subtraction    |
| *        | Multiplication |
| /        | Division       |
| %        | Modulus        |
