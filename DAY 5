# 🔹 What is an Array?

An array is a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations.

In Python, arrays are implemented using **lists**.

Example:
```python
arr = [10, 20, 30, 40]

Each element has an index:

Index:  0   1   2   3
Value: 10  20  30  40


Access element:

print(arr[0])  # Output: 10

🔹 Creating Lists
arr = [1, 2, 3]
numbers = []
mixed = [1, "hello", True]

Traversing a List
Method 1: Using Index (Important for DSA)
for i in range(len(arr)):
    print(arr[i])

Method 2: Direct Traversal
for element in arr:
    print(element)


Index-based traversal is more powerful in DSA problems.

🔹 Taking List Input from User
arr = list(map(int, input("Enter numbers: ").split()))


Example Input:

1 2 3 4 5


Output:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

🔹 Basic List Operations
Append (Add element at end)
arr.append(50)

Insert at specific position
arr.insert(1, 99)

Remove element by value
arr.remove(20)

Delete element by index
del arr[2]
