# 🔹 What is an Array?

An array is a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations.

In Python, arrays are implemented using **lists**.

Example:
```python
arr = [10, 20, 30, 40]

Each element has an index:

Index:  0   1   2   3
Value: 10  20  30  40


Access element:

print(arr[0])  # Output: 10

🔹 Creating Lists
arr = [1, 2, 3]
numbers = []
mixed = [1, "hello", True]
