# 🔹 What is Time Complexity?

Time Complexity measures how the running time of an algorithm grows as input size increases.

We measure growth pattern, not actual seconds.

---

## 🔹 Common Time Complexities

| Complexity | Meaning | Example |
|------------|----------|----------|
| O(1) | Constant | Access arr[0] |
| O(n) | Linear | Single loop |
| O(n²) | Quadratic | Nested loops |
| O(log n) | Logarithmic | Binary Search |
| O(n³) | Cubic | Triple dependent loops |

---

## 🔹 Important Big-O Rules

- Ignore constants  
  - O(5n) → O(n)
- Ignore smaller terms  
  - O(n² + n) → O(n²)
- Multiply nested loops
- Add separate loops

---

## 🔹 Examples

### Example 1
```python
for i in range(n):
    print(i)

- Time Complexity: O(n)

### Example 2
```python
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        print(i, j)


- Time Complexity: O(n²)

### Example 3
```python
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(100):
        print(i, j)


- Time Complexity: O(n)
- (100 is constant → ignored)


Example 4 (Dependent Loops)
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i):
        print(i, j)


Time Complexity: O(n²)

Example 5 (Triple Dependent Loops)
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i):
        for k in range(j):
            print(i, j, k)


Time Complexity: O(n³)

🔹 What is Space Complexity?

Space Complexity measures extra memory used by the algorithm.

Example:

a = 10
b = 20


Space Complexity: O(1)

Example:

arr = [1,2,3,4]


Space Complexity: O(n)
