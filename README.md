# 📘 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) – Python

This repository contains my **step-by-step learning journey of Data Structures and Algorithms using Python**.  
I am following a **structured daily roadmap** starting from Python fundamentals and moving towards advanced DSA topics.

The goal of this repository is to:
- Build strong DSA fundamentals
- Practice problem-solving consistently
- Prepare for technical interviews
- Maintain clean, well-documented notes and code

---

## 🧠 Learning Approach
- Language: **Python**
- Focus: **Concept clarity + practice**
- Each topic is divided into **daily folders**
- Every folder contains:
  - Concept notes
  - Practice problems
  - Clean Python implementations
